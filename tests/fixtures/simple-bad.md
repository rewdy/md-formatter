#   Simple Document


This is a simple markdown document with basic formatting elements.

##  Lists
Here are some unordered items:
*  First item
* Second item
*    Third item with more text that could potentially wrap if it were longer

And an ordered list:
1) Step one
2) Step two
3) Step three

## Links and Emphasis
This paragraph has __bold text__ and _italic text_ as well as a [link to example](https://example.com) site.

You can also use `inline code` for technical terms.

##  Table
|Name|Age|City|
|---|---|---|
|Alice|30|New York|
|Bob|25|London|
|Carol|35|Paris|

##   Conclusion
That's the end of our simple document.
