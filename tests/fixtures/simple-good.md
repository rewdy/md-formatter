# Simple Document

This is a simple markdown document with basic formatting elements.

## Lists

Here are some unordered items:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item with more text that could potentially wrap if it were longer

And an ordered list:

1. Step one
1. Step two
1. Step three

## Links and Emphasis

This paragraph has **bold text** and *italic text* as well as a
[link to example](https://example.com) site.

You can also use `inline code` for technical terms.

## Table

| Name  | Age | City     |
| ----- | --- | -------- |
| Alice | 30  | New York |
| Bob   | 25  | London   |
| Carol | 35  | Paris    |

## Conclusion

That's the end of our simple document.
