#  Complex Document

This is a more complex markdown document that tests many features.


##  Introduction


Welcome to this comprehensive test document. It contains __bold__, _italic_, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code` formatting. Here's a [link to GitHub](https://github.com).

##   Images
Here's an image reference:
![Alt text for image](https://example.com/image.png)

And another with a title:
![Logo](https://example.com/logo.svg "Company Logo")

## Code Blocks
Here's a Python code block:
```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple greeting function."""
    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```
And some JavaScript:
```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greet("World");
```
